Running ComfyUI locally requires careful consideration of your system's capabilities. The minimum requirements include a modern GPU with at least 6GB of VRAM, though 8GB or more is recommended for optimal performance. NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support provide the best compatibility, while AMD and Intel GPUs can work with appropriate drivers and configuration.

For CPU requirements, a modern multi-core processor is essential, with at least 16GB of system RAM recommended. Storage requirements vary significantly based on the models you plan to use, with a minimum of 50GB free space recommended, though serious users often require 200GB or more for comprehensive model collections.

### Software Prerequisites
Before beginning the ComfyUI installation, ensure your system has the necessary software foundations. Python 3.8 or newer is required, with Python 3.10 recommended for optimal compatibility. Git installation is necessary for cloning repositories and managing updates.

For Windows users, Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio Community Edition provides the compilation tools needed for certain Python packages. Linux users should ensure they have essential development tools installed through their distribution's package manager.

## Step-by-Step Installation Process

### Method 1: Standalone Installation
The standalone installation method provides the most control over your ComfyUI setup and is recommended for users who want to understand the underlying components.

Begin by creating a dedicated directory for your ComfyUI installation. Clone the [official ComfyUI repository](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) from GitHub using git clone, ensuring you're downloading from the verified source to avoid security issues.

Create a Python virtual environment within your ComfyUI directory to isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python applications on your system. Activate the virtual environment and install the required dependencies using pip and the provided requirements.txt file.

### Method 2: Portable Installation
For users who prefer a more streamlined approach, portable installations package ComfyUI with all necessary dependencies in a self-contained format. Download the appropriate portable package for your operating system from the official releases page.

Extract the portable package to your desired location and run the included setup script. This method is particularly useful for users who want to quickly start using ComfyUI without dealing with Python environment management.

### GPU Configuration
Proper GPU configuration is crucial for optimal ComfyUI performance. For NVIDIA GPUs, install the latest [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) compatible with your GPU model. Verify CUDA installation by running nvidia-smi and checking that CUDA is properly detected.

For AMD GPUs on Windows, install ROCm support following AMD's official documentation. Linux users with AMD GPUs should install the ROCm drivers and ensure proper permissions for GPU access.

## Essential Configuration Steps

### Model Directory Setup
ComfyUI requires proper model directory structure for optimal functionality. Create the following directories within your ComfyUI installation: models/checkpoints for Stable Diffusion models, models/loras for LoRA files, models/controlnet for ControlNet models, and models/embeddings for textual inversions.

Download essential models to get started with basic functionality. The Stable Diffusion 1.5 base model provides broad compatibility, while SDXL models offer higher quality output for compatible hardware.

### Custom Nodes Installation
ComfyUI's functionality can be significantly extended through custom nodes. The ComfyUI Manager node provides an excellent starting point for managing additional nodes and dependencies.

Install the ComfyUI Manager by cloning its repository into the custom_nodes directory. This tool simplifies the process of discovering, installing, and updating custom nodes from the community.

### Performance Optimization
Configure ComfyUI for optimal performance on your specific hardware configuration. Adjust the --vram-mode flag based on your GPU's memory capacity: use --normalvram for GPUs with 8GB or more, --lowvram for 6-8GB GPUs, and --cpu for systems without compatible GPUs.

Enable memory-efficient attention mechanisms and configure batch sizes appropriate for your hardware. These optimizations significantly impact generation speed and system stability.

## Model Management and Organization

### Model Acquisition
Understanding where and how to obtain models safely is crucial for a functional ComfyUI setup. Hugging Face serves as the primary repository for most models, providing verified and safe downloads. Civitai offers a wide selection of community-created models with user ratings and examples.

Always verify model sources and scan downloaded files for security threats. Avoid unofficial or suspicious download sources that may contain malicious code or corrupted files.

### Organization Strategies
Develop a systematic approach to model organization that scales with your collection. Use descriptive filenames that include model type, version, and key characteristics. Create subdirectories within model folders to categorize by style, purpose, or quality level.

Maintain a model inventory document that tracks model sources, licenses, and performance characteristics. This documentation becomes invaluable as your model collection grows.

### Version Control
Implement version control for your ComfyUI installation and custom workflows. Git repositories provide excellent tracking for workflow files and configuration changes. Create regular backups of your models directory and workflow collections.
